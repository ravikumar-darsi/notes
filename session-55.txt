spot
-------
on demand instances

10000 CPU, 100000 TB HD

8000 CPU, 8000 TB 

2000CPU, 2000TB

spot instances --> 70% discount of normal
2minutes notice, they will take back instances


resources in pod
---------------------
VM vs containerisation

VM --> 2GB 2CPU --> resources are blocked irrespective of usage
containerisation --> containers don't block resources, they are used dynamically

1 VM --> roboshop containers/pods, amazon containers/pods

traffic increased/code caused more resources to consume

VM will be blocked by a single container

we can restrict the resources consumed by containers...

1000m = 1cpu
250m = 0.25cpu

Where to store configuration?

AWS --> 

Services
---------------
if you want to expose pods to other applications or outside we must use services..

1. expose to other apps or outside world
2. load balancing
3. service mesh

1. Cluster IP --> purely internal to kubernets
2. NodePort --> you can expose to outside world
3. LoadBalancer --> you can expose to outside world

Project: roboshop
Component: catalogue
Tier: tier-2

what if we want multiple pods?

ReplicaSet

nginx-rs-<random-id>

catalogue:1.0.0

catalogue:1.2.0

cluster-ip < node-port < load-balancer

pod < replicaset < deployment

nginx-deployment-5ff5b64b7d-88jcc

nginx-deployment-5ff5b64b7d --> rs

nginx-deployment-5c9bf7649d --> new rs
