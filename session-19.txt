variables
--------------------
DRY --> dont repeat yourself

variables we keep aside from the code, so that code will not be disturbed when we are doing changes.

variable holds a value, you can use it anywhere

data types
-------------------
list
map
boolean
key, value

conditions
-----------------
id roboshop
if not exist we created, if exist we skipped

SOME_VAR=$(command)
