Roboshop configure
---------------------
1. Web/frontend tier
2. App/Api/Backend tier
3. DB tier

DB apps are called statefull
App/Web apps are called stateless

CRUD over database
--------------------
create user
read user
update profile
delete profile

nginx is used as reverse proxy here.

RHEL = Fedora = CentOs = AWS Linux

CentOs

devops-practice based on centos-8

centos/DevOps321

Web
-----------
http = web server
nginx = 80

dnf vs yum
-----------
centos 7 = yum is default package
centos 8/9 = dnf is default package manager

yum > dnf in memory

/etc/nginx


forward proxy vs reverse proxy
-------------------------------
VPN --> virtual private network

Servers are not aware of clients are behind VPN
anonymous access --> hiding our identity

forward proxies can't understand real clients

security --> companies can impose restrictions not to use particular sites, file upload and to monitor use internet behaviour

clients are aware of proxy, servers are not aware

reverse proxy
-------------------------------
clients are not aware of server side
apps use reverse proxy to secure their code
load balancing

http://54.197.5.96/api/catalogue/categories --> querying catalogue to know the product categories

HTTP status
--------------------
2** --> success
3** --> redirect/temp --> images, gifs are redirected

failure responses
-----------------
400, 404, 403, 402

4** --> client side error
5** --> server side error --> purely project error

MongoDB
-----------------

forward proxy vs reverse proxy

caching
--------------
Airtel --> 1000 users

1 user downloaded bahubali movie --> server from US
cache server --> bahubali movie

2nd user get from cache server --> more speed

127.0.0.1 --> localhost

dnf install nginx -y
systemctl start nginx -->


http://54.197.5.96/api/catalogue/categories

304 --> not modified
