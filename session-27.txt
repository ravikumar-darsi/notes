variables and precedence
conditions
	condition ? "true" : "false"
	
functions
loops
	count based loops --> useful mostly to iterate lists
	foreach --> useful to iterate maps
	dynamic loop
outputs
locals

data sources
------------------
it is useful to query the data dynamically from providers

foreach loop
-------------------
terraform will give variable each
80
443
22

state and remote state
---------------------
whatever we write it should create --> declarative

declarative = desired state
current state = terraform.tfstate

desired state == current state

terraform will check current state, if current state is equal to desired state then it will not take any action...

pushing to github

another devops-2 cloned the repo and tried to run again

devops-1 and devops-2

both are running terraform apply

duplicates may come, some resources got error as already exist..

we need to a central state file to check the infra exists or not...

1. collabaration
	terraform will have no idea about the infra created, if multiple persons are working on same infra, it will try to create duplicates and errors may also come
2. security
	tfstate is a crucial, if you keep it in local it may be deleted or updated by mistake.
