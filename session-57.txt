stateful vs stateless
-----------------------
storage
	CRUD --> create data, read the data, update data, delete data..
	file
	excel
	logs
	RDBMS
	NoSQL

stateful applications --> doing operations on the data directly.

catalogue cart user shipping payment web --> no own database, apps are not storing anything
stateless Applications

we can immidiately restore, no business impact..

data is getting stored in EC2 worker nodes..

pods are ephemeral, nodes are also ephemeral.

storage or k8 volumes
-----------
stores data in worker nodes, internal volumes
1. emptyDir
	used for sidecar patterns, we mount the volume to sidecar and main container using emptyDir. then sidecar get access to storage
	
	filebeat --> public image from elasticsearch

there is some configuration for filebeat
1. i/p and o/p --> i/p is what logs to access, o/p is where to ship the logs

2. hostPath --> we need to ship all the worker node logs to external system. 

DeamonSet --> will make sure a pod runs in each and every node.. fluentd will be deployed as deamonset that can access the underlying host logs and send them to ELK

/var/log directory and ship it...

external volumes
---------------
1. static provisioning
2. dynamic provisioning
