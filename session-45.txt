commit-B - commit-A = new code

git --> multiple branches...multi branch pipeline

Language, Deployment platform
NodeJs, AWS VM/Docker/Kubernetes/PCF/On-prem VM

HDFC --> 200 projects and many microservices

nodejsvm pipeline --> don't duplicate the pipeline code

reuse, implement best standards and force others to use
nodejsvm pipeline --> implement best standards, reuse, centralised

jenkins shared library --> treat your pipeline as library, use it wherever you want

process
-----------
1. create a feature branch in catalogue
2. configure multi branch pipeline
3. configure jenkins shared library

1. I created a repo and added pipelines there
2. I added in jenkins system configuration, location and name of the library

nodejsvm/javavm/pythonvm/govm is a centralised pipeline, we need to send parameters
