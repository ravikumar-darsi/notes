Change management process
---------------------------
we will raise a CR --> every organisation will have their own tool to manage CR.

project code, application code, version, JIRA ID, approvals, date and time, deployment process, revert back process, post deployment testing.

NEW --> CR ID
Approve --> write some comments
Delivery manager --> write some comments and approve
Cleint --> approve

JIRA --> Jenkins integration

trigger PROD --> JIRA will check CR is approved or not, prod trigger time is same as time in CR.

Jenkins pipeline

DEV and PROD infra

DEV will do a change in source code, a pipeline will automatically trigger to deploy the application into DEV..

then we will deploy into PROD

functional testing
------------------
microservices
1 microservice is handled by 1 person --> Developers are writing functional test cases

Once DEV deployment is over, either developer/tester have to provide the scripts and command to perform functional testing,
