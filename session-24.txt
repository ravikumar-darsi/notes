u4392854194586174598yhf --> devops

how to create ansible vault
--------------------------
ansible-vault create /path/some-name.yaml

dynamic inventory
--------------------------
we have servers, domains

we had on premise servers, apps are deployed manually
we used shell script to configure

2016 --> internet usage, digital revolution
2010/2012 --> EU, US

autoscaling of servers highly required


we are using ansible to configure
	- if you have more servers dynamically
	
10 servers now --> because of traffic

I need to run ansilbe playbook against these servers

ansible --> AWS --> fetch ip address of the servers dynamically

fetch instances with name web in us-east-1

plug and play

if ansible have plugin to connect aws ec2, we can fetch ip addresses

boto and botocore --> aws python modules

ansible uses boto and botocore in background to connect aws
