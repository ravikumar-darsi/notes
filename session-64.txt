CAT-1 --> end user applications --> banking
CAT-2 --> end user applications --> extra requests from customers
CAT-3 -->
CAT-4 --> 

Monitoring
------------
SRE --> Jenkins, Nexus, SonarQube, EKS, Ansible
	Authentication
	Authorization
	Upgrades
	Patches
	Maintainance --> admin activities
	Project creation
	Traffic
	Monitoring --> tool/website should be running 24*7 with low latency

Black Box --> closed, we don't know internal details of app/system
White Box -> open. we know internal details of app/system

normal facebook user --> black box
-------------------
1. is facebook running or not?
2. login is working or not
3. input validations
4. functionality testing

white box --> you should know internal details
-------------------
1. all fb servers are up and running
2. CPU, memory, disk, i/o
3. log errors
4. latency b/w internal components

Alert --> that is an incident

investigate the incident

find why, implement solution, prepare root cause

Latency --> Low latency
Traffic --> measure traffic everytime
Errors --> Log errors, application errors 5**
Saturation --> CPU, Memory, Disk
10

30
40

time series database
---------------------
11-MAR --> 1000 --> food 200, travel 200, movies 200
12-MAR --> 900

weekly expenditure
monthly expenditure
quarterly expenditure
yearly expenditure
max expenditure

applications
-------------------
timestamp --> cpu 50
			  cpu 52
			  cpu 45
			  cpu 67

Agent mechanism
---------------
CCTV Mechanism

CCTV cameras --> data collectors
Central Storage --> analyse

periodic time intervals --> 1m, 2m, 5m, 1s, 10s, 15s

1. node exporter is running continously and getting the metrics from its node

grafana
------------
a nice graph tool, it can get data from multiple sources. prometheus is one of the source...

dynamic scrapping
-----------------
in cloud and dynamic environments iP address are ephemeral.
