Ansible
-------------------
shell disadvantages

1. shell script will not work in all linux distros.
2. scalability --> difficult to manage more no of servers
3. error handling and validations, need to manual
4. readability
5. shell will only work for linux, will not work with external systems

Configuration management
-------------------
configure your laptop
to make server ready for application deployment is called configuring server

deployment
------------
1. stop the server
2. remove old code
3. download new code
4. restart server


Idempotence --> 

if you run a program multiple time, that can create samething multiple times
even you run your program infinite times, it should not create any damage

providing same result irrespective of no.of executions is called idempotence


useradd ramesh
1. it will create multiple ramesh users --> bad
2. it will try to create user, but got error and program exit --> no

ansible --> if not exist it will create, if exist it will ignore --> yes


Delhi --> Hyderabad --> today

Delhi --> HYD DTDC

You  going to HYD DTDC everyday and ask for courier
2nd day
3rd day
4th day
5th day --> got courier

HYD DTDC --> deliver to home

traffic increases
fuel consumption
resources waste
time waste

pull based configure
-------------------
chef server

we will configure agents to check every 1 hour

24*7 = 168 time connect to server
bandwidth waste
resources consumption like CPU and memory

pull configuration have one advantage --> at the end of ansible

Linux --> everything is called as command
ansible --> module/collection

one by one module --> success/fail

keep all modules/commands in a file
keep some validations, conditions, loops, variables
now run the file

Playbook --> a file of modules/collections
YAML --> yet another markup language

	"Emai": "info@joindevops.com",
	"Password":"admin123"
