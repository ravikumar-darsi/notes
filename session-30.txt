we need to update packages, we need to download something. We should connect internet
outgoing
incoming traffic is disabled...
NAT gateway should be in public subnet because it has internet connectivity, then we add i in the route tables..

Project = roboshop
Terraform = true

merge common tags and resource tags

roboshop-dev --> 
roboshop-prod

I will fetch az from AWS using data source and I will get first 2 AZ.

slice(list, 0, 2) --> 0,1
