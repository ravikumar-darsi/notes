taints and tolerations

taint = paint

100 rs paint

if I taint a node, then by default scheduler can't schedule pod on that node...

few projects they add their own nodes to eks cluster. then they taint the nodes...

tolerations is a excuse, pods specific to that project can have tolerations..

taint
------
kubectl taint nodes ip-10-0-11-33.ec2.internal project=roboshop:NoSchedule


affinitiy and anti affinitiy
----------------------------
1a node --> ebs also should be in 1a

requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution
	schedule --> hard rule, while scheduling also labels should be matched
	execute
preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution


kubectl label nodes ip-10-0-11-33.ec2.internal project=roboshop

kubectl label nodes ip-10-0-12-172.ec2.internal project=amazon

pod1 is running, pod2 likes pod1. so pod2 wants to run where pod1 is running


2 replicas, anti-affinity
-----------------------------
redis
-----
1st replica --> it will select node-1
2nd replica --> it should not select node-1 because of anti-affinity

web-store
-----
pod-1
-----
anti-affinity --> 1st pod will select any node i.e node-1.
go and select where app:store is running

pod-2
------
anti-affinity --> because of anti-affinity on replica-1, it goes to node-2

you can announce no create/update of applications, no releases or changes
------------------------------------------------------------------------
blue --> green

1. create a seperate node group called green
2. we need to taint new nodes
3. upgrade control plane to 1.28
4. upgrade green node group to 1.28
5. taint blue nodes so that new pods will not be scheduled
	
6. untaint green
7. cordon/drain the blue nodes...
